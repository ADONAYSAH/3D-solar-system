#  3D Solar System Simulation
A C++ OpenGL project built in Code::Blocks using GLUT and GLEW, this simulation visualizes a dynamic 3D solar system with:

-Planetary motion (realistic orbits and rotation)

-Asteroids and stars scattered throughout the space

-Camera movement to explore the scene from different angles

-Textured planets and lighting effects to enhance realism

Technologies Used:
C++

OpenGL (GLUT + GLEW)

Code::Blocks IDE

Features:
Orbiting planets with different speeds and distances from the sun

Rotating planets and moons

Background stars and asteroid belt

Free and fixed camera control for navigation
