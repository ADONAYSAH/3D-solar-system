#  3D Solar System Simulation
A C++ OpenGL project built in Code::Blocks using GLUT and GLEW, this simulation visualizes a dynamic 3D solar system with:

🌍 Planetary motion (realistic orbits and rotation)

☄️ Asteroids and stars scattered throughout the space

🎥 Camera movement to explore the scene from different angles

🪐 Textured planets and lighting effects to enhance realism

🔧 Technologies Used:
C++

OpenGL (GLUT + GLEW)

Code::Blocks IDE

🎮 Features:
Orbiting planets with different speeds and distances from the sun

Rotating planets and moons

Background stars and asteroid belt

Free and fixed camera control for navigation
